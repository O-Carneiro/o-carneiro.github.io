The second tutorial was quite a bit shorter than the first one. I ended up doing it
(kind of) twice because I mistakenly did it "kw-less" once and then had to configure
kw afterwards. However, I feel like doing that is an overstatement as configuring kw 
was very straightforward. Redoing the latter parts (building and connecting to the 
vm) with kw felt much easier than natively.

Other than forgetting to use kw, I had no major struggles with the process. Just normal
"did not read the next part of the tutorial" mistakes and errors.
